# DroneTeleOp
A teleoperation interface and implementation that allows for a user to control the tum_simulator's ARDrone from the terminal. Uses TermIOS. Interfaces with ROS and Gazebo.

Drone TeleOp is a teleoperation interface for the Ubuntu terminal that allows a user to operate the ARDrone model from tum_simulator within Gazebo. Currently, the project allows for safe "hopping" style movement, since fluid and continuous movement is still a little buggy.
